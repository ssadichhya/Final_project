# ETL Project README

This README provides an overview of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project that processes a job description dataset obtained from Kaggle using PySpark. The project involves performing data validation, cleaning, and transformation, and loading the clean data into a PostgreSQL database. We will also be using Apache Airflow for workflow automation and Apache Superset for data visualization and exploration.

## Services Used

The following services and tools will be used for this ETL project:

- **PySpark**: A powerful data processing framework for big data and analytics.
- **PostgreSQL**: An open-source relational database management system for storing the cleaned data.
- **Apache Airflow**: A platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows.
- **Apache Superset**: An open-source data exploration and visualization platform.

## Requirements

The project will involve several steps to ensure data quality and consistency. These include:

### Data Validation

1. **Validate Column Headers**: Check and ensure that the dataset's column headers are consistent with the expected format.

2. **Validate Date Column**: Verify that the date column is correctly formatted and in a consistent date format.

3. **Validate Data Types**: Ensure that the data types of each column are correct and match their respective values.

4. **Validate "Company Size" Column**: Check for negative values in the "Company Size" column and address any issues.

### Data Cleaning

1. **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate records to maintain data integrity.

2. **Handle Missing or Inconsistent Data**: Address missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset by cleaning and imputing data where necessary.

3. **Remove Dictionary Column**: If the dataset contains a column with dictionary values that are not needed, this column should be removed.

4. **Handle Negative Values in "Company Size"**: Correct any negative values in the "Company Size" column.

5. **Drop Unnecessary Columns**: Eliminate columns that are not relevant to the analysis or have been identified as unnecessary.

6. **Change Data to Standard Data Types**: Ensure that data is in the appropriate and consistent data types for analysis.

### Data Transformation

1. **Convert Salary Range to Average Salary**: Utilize a User-Defined Function (UDF) to calculate and replace salary range values with the average salary for better analysis.

2. **Change Job Posting Date**: If the "Job Posting Date" column is not already in DateTime format, transform it into a DateTime object for consistency.

## Project Execution

1. **Extract**: Obtain the job description dataset from Kaggle and load it into the PySpark environment.

2. **Transform**: Apply the data validation, cleaning, and transformation processes as specified in the requirements section.

3. **Load**: Load the cleaned and transformed data into a PostgreSQL database.

4. **Automate with Airflow**: Schedule and automate this ETL process using Apache Airflow to ensure regular updates and data maintenance.

5. **Explore Data with Superset**: After loading the data into PostgreSQL, you can use Apache Superset to create dashboards, reports, and perform data exploration and visualization.
